Our goal of this project was to analyze the endurance of different songs to determine which songs have a longer lifespan than their contemporaries, and stronger vitality to resist the time elapsing. 
To analyze our hypothesis we used data set from Spotify, Billboard and last.fm. Using the features from these datasets we created a linear based regression model to predict the popularity of songs, which achieved a train RMSE:  12.08  and test MSE:  12.53.
